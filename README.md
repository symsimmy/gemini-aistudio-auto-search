## The Problem ü§î

The Gemini models within Google AI Studio can provide more up-to-date answers by enabling the "Grounding with Google Search" option, which fetches the latest information from the web. However, AI Studio has an inconvenient behavior:

1.  This option is disabled by default.
2.  Users need to manually re-enable this option *every time* they start a new conversation, as it doesn't remember the setting.

This is tedious and easy to forget for users who want their AI responses consistently grounded in the latest information.

## The Solution ‚ú®

This Chrome extension automates this task for you!

When you visit aistudio.google.com and are about to start or continue a conversation, this extension automatically detects and ensures that the "Grounding with Google Search" toggle (usually a checkbox or switch) is **enabled**.

## Features ‚≠ê

*   **Automatic Enablement:** Automatically checks the Google Search grounding option without any manual intervention.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Works silently in the background after installation, not disrupting your workflow.
*   **Improved Efficiency:** Saves you the hassle of manually enabling the switch for every new conversation, letting you focus on interacting with the AI.
*   **Ensured Timeliness:** Helps ensure your AI Studio conversations leverage the latest web information whenever possible.
